Anytime Fitness Nutrition Knowledge Pack (Australia)
1. Purpose & Audience

This guide is for Anytime Fitness members and prospects in Australia who want their eating to actually support their training — getting lean, building muscle, feeling energised, and staying healthy in the long term. It’s written for generally healthy adults training in a normal 24/7 commercial gym.

It is not medical nutrition therapy. If someone is pregnant/breastfeeding, under 18, has diabetes, coeliac disease, kidney/heart issues, food allergies, a history of disordered eating, or describes binge–restrict patterns → they should speak with their GP or an Accredited Practising Dietitian (APD).

2. How to Use This Guide

Start with the fundamentals.

Pick the goal section that matches what you’re doing in the gym.

Build 2–4 repeatable meals from supermarket foods.

Adjust weekly based on bodyweight, hunger, and training performance.

If something falls outside general fitness scope → refer on.

3. Fundamentals of Gym-Focused Eating
3.1 Energy Balance

Eat about what you burn → weight stays similar.

Eat a bit less than you burn → fat loss.

Eat a bit more than you burn → weight/muscle gain.

Best results come from small, repeatable changes, not crash diets.

3.2 Macronutrients

Protein: repairs and builds muscle, supports recovery. Aim mostly from lean meat, chicken, eggs, fish, Greek yoghurt, cottage cheese, tofu/tempeh, or protein powder. For people lifting, 1.6–2.2 g/kg/day is the usual evidence-based range.

Carbohydrate: main fuel for training and faster recovery — rice, oats, pasta, bread, wraps, fruit, potato. Keep some carbs near training. 
Sports Dietitians Australia (SDA)

Fats: support hormones and overall health — extra-virgin olive oil, nuts, seeds, avocado, salmon.

3.3 Micronutrients, Fibre & Variety

Australian guidelines still say: plenty of veg, some fruit, wholegrains, dairy/dairy alternatives, and lean proteins, with minimal highly processed foods. Aim for 3+ serves veg and 2 serves fruit daily, and 25–35 g fibre. This fixes most “I’m always hungry” problems.

3.4 Hydration

Most adults do fine on 2–3 L/day, more in summer, long sessions, or if you sweat heavily. Pale urine most of the day is a good sign. AF members who train hard or in heat can use low-sugar electrolyte drinks.

4. Goal-Based Nutrition
4.1 Fat Loss (most common)

Deficit size: start with ~300–500 kcal/day below maintenance so you can still train. Bigger deficits = worse adherence.

Protein: 1.6–2.2 g/kg/day to protect muscle.

Carbs/fats: flexible — leave enough carbs around sessions so you don’t feel flat.

Rate of loss: ~0.5–1.0% of bodyweight/week.

Keep lifting: 2–4+ resistance sessions/week.

Aussie sample day

Breakfast: protein oats (oats + whey + berries)

Lunch: chicken breast, microwave rice, mixed frozen veg

Snack: Greek yoghurt + fruit

Dinner: lean beef mince with veg + small pasta/rice

4.2 Muscle Gain / Body Recomp

Energy: slight surplus (200–300 kcal/day) or at least maintenance if you’re new to lifting.

Protein: 1.6–2.2 g/kg/day.

Carbs: keep them in, especially pre/post training.

Sleep & progression: you only grow if training → recover → repeat.

Sample day

Pre-gym: chicken salad wrap + cheese

Post-gym: rice + chicken thigh + veggies

Snacks: Greek yoghurt, tinned tuna + crackers, protein shake

4.3 General Health / Busy Members

Aim for maintenance.

Plate model: ¼ protein, ¼ smart carb, ½ veg/salad, + healthy fat.

Minimums: 2 fruit + 3 veg.

Swap to higher-protein versions of normal foods.

5. Estimating Daily Intake

Pick a starting range: bodyweight (kg) × 25–30 kcal = rough daily calories for active AF members.

Fat loss → lower end

Muscle gain → upper end

Hit protein first (1.6–2.2 g/kg).

Split the rest between carbs and fats in a way you can stick to.

Track for 2–3 weeks:

Not losing? Drop 150–250 kcal.

Losing too fast / low energy? Add 150–250 kcal.

6. Meal Structure & Timing

Most people do well on 2–4 meals + 1 snack.

Include protein every time (25–40 g/meal) — this helps muscle protein synthesis across the day.

If training after work (5–7 pm):

Breakfast: protein oats

Lunch: chicken, rice, veg

3–4 pm: banana + yoghurt or tuna + crackers

Post-workout dinner: protein + carb + veg

If training in the morning:

Light pre-gym if needed (toast + PB, or yoghurt + fruit)

Bigger breakfast after (eggs on toast + veg)

Pre-workout (1–2 hrs): carb + small protein, low fat/fibre.
Post-workout (0–2 hrs): 20–40 g protein + carbs to refuel. This matters more if you train again soon or are chasing performance. 
Sports Dietitians Australia (SDA)

Use supermarket shortcuts: BBQ/roast chicken, microwave rice, frozen veg, tinned fish, wraps.

7. Training-Day vs Rest-Day Eating

Performance focus: keep protein the same, push carbs a bit higher on training days.

Fat-loss focus: you can keep days fairly even so prep is easier.

Hot Aussie weather or long sessions → up fluids and salt/electrolytes. 
Sports Dietitians Australia (SDA)

8. Special Patterns & Preferences
8.1 Vegetarian / Mostly Plant-Based

Protein from eggs, Greek yoghurt, cottage cheese, tofu/tempeh, legumes, lentil pasta, quality plant protein powders.

Combine across the day to reach 1.2–1.8 g/kg if lifting.

Watch iron, B12, calcium — refer if unsure. 
Sports Dietitians Australia (SDA)

8.2 Budget-Friendly

Tinned tuna/salmon, eggs, frozen chicken, frozen veg, oats, rice, lentils/beans.

Buy in bulk, cook once, eat twice.

8.3 Eating Out / Takeaway

Choose grilled over fried.

Add or keep the protein.

Swap chips for salad or half chips.

Watch liquid calories (soft drink, alcohol, large milky coffees).

8.4 Shift Workers / 24/7 Trainers

Keep total daily intake the priority, not perfect “meal times”.

Avoid massive high-fat meals right before trying to sleep.

Keep a “grab-and-go” kit: protein shake, nut mix, fruit, tinned fish.

8.5 Fasting / Ramadan

Front-load hydration and electrolytes when you can.

Break the fast with protein + carbs + fluids.

If training while fasting, lower volume/intensity or move sessions.

8.6 Possible Intolerances

If someone describes bloating, pain, or suspects low FODMAP/coeliac → this is dietitian territory; give general healthy-eating advice only and refer.

9. Hydration & Electrolytes (Detail)

Base: 2–3 L water/day.

More if: hot, long sessions, heavy sweater, outdoor job.

Electrolytes/sports drinks: useful if training >60 mins, sweating a lot, or back-to-back sessions. Pick lower-sugar options during fat loss. 
Sports Dietitians Australia (SDA)

People with blood pressure/renal/heart issues → check with GP.

10. Supplements (Conservative, Gym-Focused)

Food first — supplements fill gaps or improve convenience.

Common, generally safe for healthy adults:

Whey or plant protein: to hit daily protein.

Creatine monohydrate: 3–5 g/day, any time. Great for people lifting and wanting strength/body-comp benefits. 
Sports Dietitians Australia (SDA)

Caffeine: 1–3 mg/kg 30–60 mins before training can help, but watch sleep and total daily intake. 
Sports Dietitians Australia (SDA)

Basic multivitamin: if diet is inconsistent.

Avoid / be cautious: “hardcore” fat-burners, hormone-related products, unverified online supplements.

11. Alcohol

Alcohol slows recovery and fat loss.

If you drink: keep it occasional, eat protein first, and count the calories.

Encourage at least a few alcohol-free days if chasing comp goals.

12. Red Flags & When to Refer

Refer to GP or APD when someone:

is pregnant/breastfeeding

is under 18

has diabetes, coeliac disease, kidney disease, eating disorder history

reports ongoing GI issues, severe restriction, or rapid weight loss

needs a clinical meal plan or sports-specific periodised nutrition

This matches Australian fitness scope-of-practice guidance.

13. Linking to Anytime Fitness

Food should match the member’s current AF training plan.

More sessions, more classes, or challenge blocks → probably need more total energy and carbs.

Fat-loss phase → keep training stable, use food to create the deficit.

Club services differ by location — members should check their local club for PT, challenges, or in-club resources.
