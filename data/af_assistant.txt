1. Purpose & Who This Is For
This information pack is for people training at, or thinking about joining, Anytime Fitness (AF) clubs in Australia. It explains how AF generally works: 24/7 member access, clubs that are locally owned and operated, billing usually handled by Debitsuccess, and how to get help if something goes wrong. Because clubs set many of their own details, exact prices, staffed hours, promos, personal training offers, and add-ons can differ from club to club. Use this as your starting point, then contact your own AF club for final confirmation of anything to do with money, opening times, or membership changes.

2. About Anytime Fitness in Australia
Anytime Fitness is a large, 24/7 gym network designed to fit around work, family, and study. Once you’re a current, financial member you can access your home club any time of day, all year round. Many memberships also allow access to thousands of AF clubs worldwide for active members.
Entry is normally via secure access — either a key fob issued by the club or smartphone-enabled access where available. Clubs are monitored and use CCTV and access control for member safety.
Most AF clubs in Australia are locally owned and operated. That means they follow the AF brand and standards, but some details (pricing, staffed hours, offers) will differ by suburb or state.
AF aims to be welcoming, supportive, and suitable for a wide range of fitness levels.

3. Membership & Joining
Most AF memberships in Australia follow a similar pattern:


You sign up on a membership agreement (in club or online).


You pay an initial amount (joining fee, key-fob fee, or promo rate) — amount varies by club.


You get ongoing access via direct debit (weekly, fortnightly, or monthly).


You receive 24/7 access to your home club and often to the wider AF network while your membership is active.


Important notes:


Prices, contract lengths, and promotions vary by club and time of year. Some clubs run $0 join offers, student discounts, or corporate rates. Always check with your local club.


Corporate memberships or employer-sponsored deals exist but are not available at every location.


Trial or guest passes are set by the club — some offer short trials, some don’t.


What you usually get: 24/7 gym access, use of the facility and equipment, the option to book PT or coaching, and access to AF digital/app features where available.



4. Access, Security & Staffed Hours
Anytime Fitness clubs are open to members 24/7, but they are not staffed 24/7.


24/7 access: Members can enter using their key fob or approved smartphone access at any time, including public holidays.


Staffed/office hours: These are the times when team members are onsite, you can tour the club, get help with your membership, buy an access fob, or fix access issues. These hours are set locally and can change — always check with your club.


Security: Entry is for members only, monitored by CCTV and access systems. For everyone’s safety, members must not let other people “tailgate” in behind them. Allowing non-members in can breach membership terms.


If you can’t get in (lost fob, phone not working, can’t open the door): contact your club during staffed hours so they can verify you and reset or replace your access.



5. Billing & Payments (Debitsuccess)
Most Anytime Fitness clubs in Australia use Debitsuccess to collect membership fees by direct debit.
Debitsuccess billing support (member-facing):


Phone: 1800 917 476


Email: anytimecs@debitsuccess.com


Hours: Mon–Fri 8am–6pm AEST, Sat 9am–1pm AEST (closed Sunday)


What Debitsuccess can usually help with:


A payment that failed or was dishonoured


Updating payment details


Questions about an amount that was debited


General billing-account enquiries


What your club usually handles:


Membership changes (upgrades/downgrades)


Freezes/holds


Cancellations and required notice periods


Local fees or offers attached to your membership


If a payment fails, dishonour or late fees can apply, so it’s best to contact Debitsuccess or your club quickly to avoid extra charges.
Because membership terms and promotions are set by the club, always confirm membership changes with your home club even if billing runs through Debitsuccess.

6. Club Services & Coaching
Most AF clubs offer a similar core set of services, but the exact mix depends on the location.
Typically available:


Personal Training (PT): one-to-one coaching for technique, accountability, or specific goals.


Small group/functional sessions: some clubs run regular coached sessions.


Challenges or member events: 6–8 week programs, transformation challenges, or seasonal campaigns.


Digital/app features: in many places, the AF app or smart coaching tools can help members plan workouts, track progress, or even open the door via phone (where supported).


Important:


PT, group sessions, and challenges are optional and priced separately.


Pricing and availability vary by club, and spots can be limited.


Ask your club what services are currently running and how to book or pay.



7. Transfers, Holds & Cancellations
Anytime Fitness is a large network, but your actual membership terms come from the agreement you signed with your home club. That agreement sets rules for notice periods, holds, and cancellations.
General guidance:


Transfers/moving: If you move suburbs or states, talk to your current/home club first. They can explain your options under your contract.


Holds/freezes: Many clubs allow temporary holds for travel, illness, or short breaks, sometimes with a small fee. Conditions and proof required can vary.


Cancellations: Often require notice and sometimes evidence (e.g. relocation, medical). You may be asked to return your access fob.


Many memberships roll over to an ongoing period after the initial term unless you give proper notice.


Because these rules are club-specific, always read your original membership agreement and contact your home club for changes.

8. Member Experience, Etiquette & Safety
To keep the club safe and welcoming, members are expected to follow basic gym etiquette:


Wipe down equipment after use.


Re-rack weights and return accessories.


Share equipment and be mindful of busy times.


Wear appropriate, safe footwear and clothing.


Use headphones for personal music if loud noise is discouraged at your club.


After-hours safety:


Train with awareness, especially late at night.


Let someone know you’re at the gym.


Use panic/duress devices if your club provides them.


Report damaged equipment or safety issues to the club.


Facilities such as bathrooms, stretching areas, functional zones, or extras (e.g. saunas) can differ by club. If you need a specific facility, check with the club before joining.

9. Common Member Questions & Troubleshooting
“I was charged a fee I don’t recognise.”


Check if a payment recently failed — dishonour fees can apply.


For billing questions, contact Debitsuccess 1800 917 476 · anytimecs@debitsuccess.com.


If the fee relates to a membership change or local promo, contact your club.


“My access fob/phone won’t let me in.”


First, make sure your payments are up to date.


Then contact your club in staffed hours so they can re-issue or reset access.


“Can I bring a friend?”


Guest/trial passes are set by each club. Call or visit your club to ask.


“Can I freeze my membership?”


Often yes, but the rules, length, and any fees are club-dependent. Contact your club.


“I moved suburbs/state.”


Talk to your current/home club first about transfer or cancellation options under your agreement.



10. When to Contact the Club vs Billing vs Emergency
Contact your club for:


Joining or touring the club


Staffed hours and public holiday variations


Membership changes (freeze, upgrade, cancel)


Local promos, PT, or challenges


Access issues that need staff to verify you


Contact Debitsuccess for:


A payment that failed or was dishonoured


Updating your payment method


Questions about a direct debit amount


General billing support


Debitsuccess member billing support: 1800 917 476 · anytimecs@debitsuccess.com · Mon–Fri 8am–6pm AEST, Sat 9am–1pm AEST (closed Sunday).
Contact emergency services immediately if there is a real-time safety, medical, or security issue in the club and staff are not present.

11. Notes on Club-to-Club Variation
Anytime Fitness clubs in Australia follow the same overall model — 24/7 access, secure entry, member-focused environment — but many details are set locally by the franchise owner or club manager.
This means:


Staffed hours can differ widely, even within the same city.


PT rates, group sessions, and challenges may or may not be available.


Joining fees, access fob costs, and promo pricing can change during the year.


Some clubs have extra facilities or stricter building rules.


Because of this, national information is a guide only. Members and prospects should always confirm money-related items, opening times, and membership changes directly with their home club.
