Anytime Fitness – Training Knowledge Pack (Australia)
1. Purpose & Audience

This guide is for people training in Anytime Fitness clubs in Australia — members, prospects, and staff who need to give safe, practical, gym-floor training guidance. It assumes access to typical AF equipment (cardio machines, barbells, dumbbells, Smith, cables, pin/plate-loaded machines, functional space).

It is general fitness information, not medical, rehab, or pregnancy-specific prescription. If someone has a current/recent injury, is pregnant/postpartum, or has a medical condition, they should get clearance and have their program customised by an AF trainer or health professional.

2. Safety First

Pain that is sharp, joint-specific, radiating, or causes numbness → stop and seek advice.

Light muscular soreness after training is normal; joint pain is not.

Use a spotter or Smith/safeties for heavy presses/squats.

New, returning, or older members should start with lower volume, slower tempo, and machine-based options until technique is reliable.

3. Training Fundamentals
3.1 How Muscles Get Stronger/Bigger

You give the muscle a resistance stimulus.

You recover (sleep, rest days, food).

You repeat it 1–3 times per week for that muscle.

Most AF members will grow well on 3–4 sets of 6–15 reps, taken close to fatigue, with clean form.

3.2 Strength vs Hypertrophy vs Endurance

Strength: 3–6 reps, heavier loads, 2–3+ min rest, compound lifts first.

Hypertrophy (muscle): 6–15 reps, moderate loads, 60–120 sec rest, more total sets.

Endurance/conditioning: 12–20+ reps, lighter loads, 30–60 sec rest, often circuit-style.
You can blend them in a week, but pick one main goal for the current phase.

3.3 Progressive Overload

Progress = the training becomes slightly more challenging over time:

add 2.5–5 kg

or do 1–2 more reps

or add 1 set

or improve range/tempo/technique

or reduce rest (for some goals)

If form breaks or pain appears, drop load and rebuild.

3.4 Training Age

Beginner (0–6 months): 2–3 full-body days, learn patterns, simple linear progress.

Intermediate (6–24 months): 3–4 days, splits (upper/lower, PPL), slower progress, more recovery.

Advanced (2+ years): needs planned variation, deloads, and smaller week-to-week changes.

Anyone with injury/pregnancy → individualise with the club trainer.

4. Warm-Up & Cooldown (Short, Practical)

Warm-up (5–10 mins):

3–5 mins light cardio (treadmill/bike/cross-trainer)

1–2 mobility/drills for today’s area

1–2 lighter ramp-up sets of the first lift

Cooldown (3–5 mins):

easy walk/bike

optional light stretching for worked areas
If something hurts in the warm-up → modify or ask staff.

5. Goal-Based Training
5.1 Fat Loss

Main training goal: keep muscle while the diet handles the fat loss.

2–4 resistance sessions/week (full body or upper/lower), 6–15 reps, big movements.

2–4 cardio sessions/week (20–35 mins) on treadmill, bike, cross-trainer, rower.

Rest 45–90 sec to fit work in.

If energy is low → reduce sets, not movement quality.

5.2 Muscle Gain

3–5 resistance sessions/week.

Each muscle 2×/week where possible.

6–15 reps, 3–4 sets, finish most sets with 1–3 reps in reserve (RIR).

Mix free weights and machines for stability and joint comfort.

Track lifts and aim to progress weekly/fortnightly.

Sleep + protein are part of the program.

5.3 Strength / Performance

Base sessions around: squat, deadlift/hinge, bench/press, row, pull-up/lat pulldown.

3–5 sets of 3–6 reps, 2–3+ min rest.

Do accessories in 8–12 reps for weak points.

Use spotters/safeties; stop if bar speed drops hard.

5.4 General Fitness / Return to Training

2–3 full-body weights + 2–3 cardio sessions/week.

Moderate reps (8–12), joint-friendly ranges.

Start with 1–2 sets per exercise and build.

6. Weekly Programming
6.1 Frequency Options

2 days: full body x2

3 days: full body x3, or upper/lower/full

4 days: upper/lower/upper/lower OR full/push/pull/lower

5 days: push/pull/legs/upper/lower (or similar)

Pick the lowest number of days you can repeat every week.

6.2 Session Templates

Full body (45–60 mins):

Squat or leg press

Upper push (bench/DB/Smith)

Upper pull (row/lat pulldown)

Hinge or posterior chain (RDL/back extension)

Core/conditioning finisher

Upper:

Push, pull, push, pull, arms, core

Lower:

Squat pattern, hinge pattern, single-leg, calves, core

Push/Pull/Legs:

Push: chest, shoulders, triceps

Pull: back, rear delts, biceps

Legs: quads, glutes, hamstrings, calves, core

6.3 Sets, Reps, Effort

Sets: 2–4 working sets per exercise

Reps: 6–15 for most goals; 3–6 for strength; 12–20 for endurance

RPE: 7–9/10 on working sets

RIR: finish with 1–3 good reps left (safer, still effective)

6.4 Rest Periods

Heavy compounds: 2–3 mins

Typical hypertrophy: 60–90 secs

Isolation/core: 30–60 secs

Circuits: rest as needed to keep technique

6.5 4–6 Week Progression

Weeks 1–2: learn, pick loads, 2–3 RIR

Weeks 3–4: add load/reps/set where you can

Weeks 5–6: hold or slightly increase volume
If feeling beat up → deload (reduce sets by ~30–40% for a week).

7. Exercise Options by Area (AF-Style)
7.1 Lower Body

Primary: barbell back/front squat, leg press, Smith squat/split squat, RDL (BB/DB), walking lunges, leg curl/extension, hip thrust (BB/Smith).
Regressions: goblet squat, bodyweight box squat, supported split squat, lighter leg press.
Progressions: Bulgarian split squat, single-leg leg press, barbell hip thrust with pause.
Cues: “brace, then move”, “knees track over toes”, control the lowering.

7.2 Push (Chest/Shoulders/Triceps)

Primary: barbell bench, DB press (flat/incline), Smith press, machine chest press, DB/Smith shoulder press, cable/DB fly, cable/rope push-down.
Regressions: machine press instead of free barbell, elevated push-ups.
Progressions: dips (assisted → bodyweight), single-arm cable press.
Cues: shoulders down/back, wrist over elbow, smooth bar path.

7.3 Pull (Back/Biceps)

Primary: lat pulldown, seated cable row, single-arm DB row, chest-supported row, Smith row, assisted pull-up.
Regressions: assisted pull-up → pulldown, lighter rows with support.
Progressions: weighted pull-ups, barbell bent-over row (good technique only).
Cues: “chest up”, “elbows to ribs”, “don’t shrug”.

7.4 Core / Posterior Chain

Planks, side planks, cable chop/Pallof, hanging or lying leg raises, machine crunch, back extension.
Regress to dead bug or shorter holds; progress to weighted holds or harder anti-rotation.
Cues: “ribs down, brace lightly”, “control the lowering”.

7.5 Conditioning / Functional

Treadmill, bike, rower, sled, KB swings (if coached).
Posture tall, breathe, stop if chest discomfort or dizziness appears — report to staff.

8. Cardio & Conditioning in AF

Steady state: 20–40 mins at a talking pace — good for health and fat loss support.

Intervals: e.g. 1 min hard, 1–2 mins easy × 8–12 on treadmill/bike/rower — good for fitness/time-poor members.

Combine with weights: lift first, then do cardio. For strength days, avoid very hard intervals right before heavy legs.

Weekly idea: 2–4 cardio sessions on top of 2–4 weights sessions. Adjust down if recovery/sleep is poor.

9. Common Limitations & Alternatives

Knee-sensitive:

leg press, box squat, goblet squat, Smith split squat, step-ups

reduce depth to pain-free range

strengthen posterior chain (RDL, hip thrust)

persistent pain → refer

Shoulder-sensitive:

swap overhead barbell for DB incline, landmine press (if available), or neutral-grip machine

keep elbows slightly forward

avoid painful range

Only 30–40 mins to train:

full body 2–3×/week

4–5 moves: squat/hinge, push, pull, core, optional cardio

45–60 sec rest

superset non-competing moves

10. Technique & Setup Notes

Bracing: small breath, tighten, then lift. Don’t hold breath long if new or medical issues.

Neutral spine: natural curve, don’t round or over-arch.

Range: use the range you can control.

When to stop a set: technique breaks, weight shifts to joints, sharp/radiating pain.

11. Injury / Medical / Pregnancy Escalation

This guide can’t diagnose or rehab. Members should be sent to staff/PT/health pro if they report:

sharp/stabbing joint pain

pain that travels/numbs/tingles

chest pain, dizziness, unusual shortness of breath

swelling, locking, or instability

pregnancy/postpartum training needs
Returning from injury → half sets, lighter loads, shorter range, more rest, rebuild slowly.

12. Club / PT Hand-Offs

Send the member to their local AF trainer/staff when:

they need their form checked in person

they want a program for their exact timetable/equipment

they have ongoing pain or special conditions

they don’t know how to set up a specific machine in that club
Local clubs can adjust exercise choice, ROM, and weekly structure.
